I am implementing some machine learning algorithims and their dependencies (like linear algebra) from scratch in go.

This is for learning purposes. Anyone is welcome to use this code and/or follow along, but anyone looking for a production
ready machine learning library in Go should checkout [golearn|https://github.com/sjwhitworth/golearn] -- it's awesome!
